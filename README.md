# Abstract
The code provides the explanation of how to use machine learning to maximize the total profit generated by managing non-customers with a credit card offer in a bank company, specially using datasets from the datathon international Interbank in which I finished sixth. Link: [Interbank-internacional-2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/interbank-internacional-2019/overview). Using stratified K-Fold and lightgbm framework provide the solution in this project. Finally using a differential evolution algorithm the cut off point is estimated maximizing the total profit.
